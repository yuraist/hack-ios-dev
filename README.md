## Resources
[CS50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjqgP9dpD1k&list=PLhQjrBD2T381L3iZyDTxRwOBuUt6m1FnW) – one of the most popular Computer Science courses developed by Harvard University. It helps to learn basics of programming. Algorithms, data structures, memory, computational thinking, the C language and more.

[Book «Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software»](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319) – a book describes how computer works. Even if you don’t have any technical background, this book will help you understand computer work.

[Swift Language Guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html) – official documentation of the Swift language provided by Apple and Swift’s open-source community.
